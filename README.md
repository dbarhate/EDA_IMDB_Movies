It is a personal data science project that analyses movies data from Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

# Description
This repository contains IPython Notebook deals with the analysis of the movies data from Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

# Introduction
The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema. This website contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more. Faced with the large amount of data available on this site, I thought that it would be interesting to analyze the film data on the IMDb website between the year 2000 and the year 2017.

# Objective
Analyze the data available on the IMDb website for movies released in the cinema between 2000 and 2017.

# Dataset
The CSV file is "dataframeMovies.csv" and the IPython Notebook is [DataScienceMovies.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicolaschen1/DataScienceMovies/blob/master/DataScienceMovies.ipynb)
